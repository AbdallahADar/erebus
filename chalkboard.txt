Keep track of ideas here:

No set format, free flowing ideas.

Decisions made:
- Infinite generated during calculation gets converted to NA in VD


-- Latest stopping point: Cut func
-- Next step:

-- TODO: When to define function as unsafe vs
         a block within function as unsafe.
         It boils down to whether the user has to guarantee safety or
         the function guarantees safety.
-- TODO: Indexing tests
         Test files are using similar helper functions.
            Create centralized helper functions and then use them.
         For some unary functions, may have not coded infinite as NA
            and I have decided (for now) that +/-Inf is NA for both float
            and int.
-- View for DateVector in indexing.rs
-- We have defined a result type, use it for existing places where we had
    ErebusError as return type.

-- Change to Make (Not immediate):
    For unary operators, instead of doing .is_nan() check to determine
    whether it is NA or not, use direct conditions when possible.
    This is because with the is_nan() setup, the following framework
    takes place: calc -> check -> write
    We should do this instead: check -> calc + write OR write.
    This new framework will avoid unnecessary calcs.
    However, this framework is not straightforward. In some cases it is simpler
    to just do the calc first and then check for simplicity.
